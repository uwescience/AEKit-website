**Corinne Bintz: Undergraduate Student, Department of Computer Science
Middlebury College:**
Corinne Bintz is an undergraduate student at Middlebury College, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Global Health. Corinne is interested in using data science and other computational tools for social good, specifically for public and global health purposes. Prior to the University of Washington Data Science for Social Good program, Corinne worked as a software engineer intern for myStrength, a digital behavioral health company in Denver, Colorado where she contributed to mobile and backend development.
Corinne has experience in machine learning and data visualization. She has worked with various nonprofit organizations dedicated to social justice, such as the YWCA and Girls Who Code. Corinne spent the past spring semester in Stockholm, Sweden studying public health in the Swedish and European context. In her free time, Corinne enjoys spending time with friends outdoors in the Pacific Northwest, including hiking, backpacking, climbing, swimming and running.

**Vivian Guetler: Doctoral Student, Department of Sociology & Anthropology
West Virginia University:**
Vivian is a fourth year Ph.D. student in sociology at West Virginia University. As an aspiring computational sociologist and data scientist, Vivian’s research has focused on the integration of technology, computational social sciences and data science through a sociological lens. Her research interests include cyberterrorism, impact of technologies on society, ethical considerations of machine learning algorithms on society, social interactions and network structures.
Her current research analyzes how terrorist groups use technologies and the role of hacktivists in countering terrorist’s social media accounts and websites. In addition, she studies algorithm biases and how they are used in the criminal justice system. Vivian studies these phenomena using qualitative and quantitative methods, network science, natural language processing, machine learning, and exploratory visualization techniques. She has presented her research in annual conferences such as the American Society of Criminology, American Sociological Association, Media Sociology Pre-Conference, Society for Terrorism Research, T2 Conference on Technology and the Future of Terror and Network Science (NetSci).
She is excited for the DSSG opportunity and to be working alongside an interdisciplinary team to help solve society’s problems through data science.

**Daniella Raz: Master’s Student, School of Information
University of Michigan:**
Daniella Raz is a master’s student at the University of Michigan’s School of Information. She holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan in Political Science and Arabic and Islamic Studies, as well as a minor in Applied Statistics. During her undergraduate studies, Daniella interned at a human rights NGO in Jerusalem, and conducted research for the Rabat Social Studies Institute in Morocco and for the Arab Barometer Project. Using public opinion data collected by Arab Barometer, Daniella wrote her bachelor’s thesis on attitudes toward gender equality in Arab Muslim societies.
Prior to starting graduate school, she interned at Google in Dublin, Ireland. There, she worked with large-scale datasets on several projects, including user experience analysis and ad optimization. At the DSSG program, Daniella is looking forward to combining her previous experiences in policy and data analysis with more recent interests in digital privacy and ethical issues arising from the implementation of artificial intelligence systems.
