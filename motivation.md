**Questions**

What ethical issues should we be concerned with? Are algorithmic systems reinforcing bias and discrimination? What do communities, policy makers and non-tech experts understand about algorithmic tools and their impacts?

The project seeks to answer questions around algorithmic ethical issues and concerns by designing an Algorithmic Equity Toolkit that identifies and audits algorithmic processes and systems of automated decision-making and predictive technologies used in the public sector.

The toolkit includes three components 1) a flow chart that identifies algorithmic systems and their attributes, 2) a checklist of red flags for surfacing the social context of a given system, its technical failure modes (i.e., potential for not working correctly, such as false positives), and its social failure modes (i.e. its potential for discrimination when working correctly); and (3) an interactive web tool that illustrates the underlying mechanics of the harms in the list of red flag, such as the relationship between how models are trained and adverse social impacts. 

The project fills a critical gap in non-expert understanding of complex and proprietary algorithmic systems.
